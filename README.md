Iâ€™m Jessie (she/her), an aspiring web developer doing self paced online learning with [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/). I enjoy games (video + tabletop + dnd!), reading, exercise, nature, and walking my dog. Iâ€™ve been learning code in earnest since early 2020, and hope to someday have a career in the tech industry! 

Feel free to reach out to me on all the socials, as I'm happy to chat :heart: ðŸ¤—
